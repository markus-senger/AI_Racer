# AI_Racer
This repository contains a Unity project that demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be used to teach an AI agent how to navigate a racing circuit. The project was developed as part of a machine learning course at university. 

Currently, the Unity project allows controlling the vehicle through mouse input. The player can steer the car on the racing circuit and navigate through the environment. However, in the next steps of development, the project aims to incorporate reinforcement learning techniques to teach an AI agent how to navigate the same circuit. The AI agent will learn to control the vehicle and improve its performance over time by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions. With reinforcement learning, the AI agent can adapt and optimize its behavior based on the feedback received, ultimately becoming an expert in driving the racing circuit.
