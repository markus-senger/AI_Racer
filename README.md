# AI_Racer
This project was developed as part of a Machine Learning course at the university. The goal of the project is to teach a racing car how to drive on a race track using Reinforcement Learning. In addition, the user can manually control the racing car using the mouse.

* The project utilizes Reinforcement Learning techniques to train the racing car to navigate the race track autonomously.
* Mouse Control: Users have the option to manually control the racing car using the mouse.
* Training on a Small Race Track: The ML agent has been successfully trained on a small race track with various reward systems, demonstrating its ability to learn and improve.
* Scope for Improvement: While the ML agent performs well on smaller and simpler race tracks, further training is required to tackle larger and more complex race tracks and achieve optimal results.

Please note that this repository is primarily intended as a learning project rather than striving for a perfect solution for autonomous driving. The main purpose is to provide an opportunity to explore and gain a better understanding of Reinforcement Learning techniques in the context of training a racing car.
